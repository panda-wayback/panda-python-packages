# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or even
#   fail to install them.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipenv, poetry.lock contains the exact versions of dependencies.

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipenv, pdm.lock contains the exact versions of dependencies.
